rewrite


pass in struct data
caches
no singleton, pass in references

driver holds all these manager/caces, then you pass around the driver by reference



finish transfering/taking notes, reviewing code, push to github

front-end
imgui: set up easy way to use and debug
memory profiler: fix all memory leaks
cpu/gpu profiler: map out cpu bottlenecks, and gpu bottlebecks
multithreading on update function and startup?
final review through all ideas. Make sure using data design where I can, classes are commented and clean and not too large.
------- IDEAS  ---------
. Focus on memory management. Lifetime, footprint, optimization
. cache design and data oriented design
. easy / simple interface. Don't overarchitecture... more explicit!
. good c++. const, references, good use of pointers, good class design.
. less shared_pointers
. linear programming, less brances
