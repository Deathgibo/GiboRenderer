get gpu timers working
get resolution picking working as well as maybe look at compute cut off
right now all my renderobjects are created on heap seperately and im looping through that. I need to create renderobject pool and allocate everything from that so we still have pointer hopping but in memory they are all right next to eachother. The other option is to have 1 data structure.

window size, rendertarget resolution, projection matrix. When i changed window size it just stretch the same image into it, maybe because i didnt change projection? just window and not rendergatet resolutions. 

I want it to render the exact thing no matter what window size or resolution is.

maybe do static material cache which would really help my renderobjects dynamic performance and less gpu memory used. 
Also maybe deal with the messy passing pointer in and passing textures, and messy interface

explore formats for rendertargets and textures, as well as see if having more than 1 byte precision for textures does anythig, as well as explore mipping-mapping, anisotropy, and multisampling shading in the pipeline

add profiling visual, like milliseconds, cpu usage, add text to overlay pass
add dynamic meshes - trampoleen, cutting holes, meta balls, etc
add shadows - 
add better geometry and geometry culling optimizations
explore better texture quality techiqnues, mega textures, formats precision, etc
explore how to load all models and quickly and get really good quality models in

*always check and optimize main update function and dynamic stuff
